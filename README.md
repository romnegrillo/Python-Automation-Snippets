# Python-Snippets

![Python-Logo](/python_logo.png?raw=true)

### About
This reposity contains snippets of code that I use for
development in Python. This includes automation, frameworks,
module usages that I made so I won't write it again from 
scratch if I needed it for other purposes. This will make
my development for other projects faster since I will just 
refer to the snippets I made previously. 

This does not contain complete projects but only a "snippet"
that can be used for bigger projects in the future.

I made Python my programming language for development. I use
Python for automation, web development, desktop development,
embedded systems and machine learning.

I separated web development and machine learning snippets
in another repository since it contains many codes that
are need to be together as a complete project.
